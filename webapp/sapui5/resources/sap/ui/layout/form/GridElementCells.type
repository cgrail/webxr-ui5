    <documentation>A string that defines the number of used cells in a &lt;code&gt;GridLayout&lt;/code&gt;. This can be a number from 1 to 16, "auto" or "full".
If set to "auto" the size is determined by the number of fields and the available cells. For labels the auto size is 3 cells.
If set to "full" only one field is allowed within the &lt;code&gt;FormElement&lt;/code&gt;. It gets the full width of the row and the label is displayed above. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; For labels full size has no effect.</documentation>
