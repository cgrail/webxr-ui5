            <documentation>Mask defined by its characters type (respectively, by its length).
You should consider the following important facts:
1. The mask characters normally correspond to an existing rule (one rule per unique char).
Characters which don't, are considered immutable characters (for example, the mask '2099', where '9' corresponds to a rule
for digits, has the characters '2' and '0' as immutable).
2. Adding a rule corresponding to the &lt;code&gt;placeholderSymbol&lt;/code&gt; is not recommended and would lead to an unpredictable behavior.
3. You can use the special escape character '^' called "Caret" prepending a rule character to make it immutable.
Use the double escape '^^' if you want to make use of the escape character as an immutable one.</documentation>
