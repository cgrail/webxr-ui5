    <documentation>A GroupSelect is a {@link sap.m.Select} control enhanced with styling according to the semantics of a common "Group" acton.

A GroupSelect cannot be used independently but only as aggregation content of a {@link sap.m.semantic.SemanticPage}.

The grouping options should be added to the &lt;code&gt;items&lt;/code&gt; aggregation of {@link sap.m.semantic.GroupSelect} and will be displayed as a pop-up list with support for single-item selection.
If this simple popup list is not sufficient for your use case, you can implement your own custom dialog by using {@link sap.m.semantic.GroupAction} to trigger the dialog opening.</documentation>
