            <documentation>Determines whether the initial focus is set automatically on first rendering and after navigating to a new page.
This is useful when on touch devices the keyboard pops out due to the focus being automatically set on an input field.
If necessary, the &lt;code&gt;afterShow&lt;/code&gt; event can be used to focus another element, only if &lt;code&gt;autoFocus&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;  The following scenarios are possible, depending on where the focus
was before navigation to a new page:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;autoFocus&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and the focus was
inside the current page, the focus will be moved automatically on the new page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;autoFocus&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; and the focus was inside
the current page, the focus will disappear.
&lt;li&gt;If the focus was outside the current page, after the navigation it will remain
unchanged regardless of what is set to the &lt;code&gt;autoFocus&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</documentation>

        <method name="addCustomTransition" type="sap.m/NavContainer">
            <documentation>Adds a custom transition to the NavContainer type (not to a particular instance!). The transition is identified by a "name". Make sure to only use names that will not collide with transitions which may be added to the NavContainer later. A suggestion is to use the prefix "c_" or "_" for your custom transitions to ensure this.

"to" and "back" are the transition functions for the forward and backward navigation.
Both will be called with the following parameters:
- oFromPage: the Control which is currently being displayed by the NavContainer
- oToPage: the Control which should be displayed by the NavContainer after the transition
- fCallback: a function which MUST be called when the transition has completed
- oTransitionParameters: a data object that can be given by application code when triggering the transition by calling to() or back(); this object could give additional information to the transition function, like the DOM element which triggered the transition or the desired transition duration

The contract for "to" and "back" is that they may do an animation of their choice, but it should not take "too long". At the beginning of the transition the target page "oToPage" does have the CSS class "sapMNavItemHidden" which initially hides the target page (visibility:hidden). The transition can do any preparation (e.g. move that page out of the screen or make it transparent) and then should remove this CSS class.
After the animation the target page "oToPage" should cover the entire screen and the source page "oFromPage" should not be visible anymore. This page should then have the CSS class "sapMNavItemHidden".
For adding/removing this or other CSS classes, the transition can use the addStyleClass/removeStyleClass method:
oFromPage.addStyleClass("sapMNavItemHidden");
When the transition is complete, it MUST call the given fCallback method to inform the NavContainer that navigation has finished!

Hint: if the target page of your transition stays black on iPhone, try wrapping the animation start into a
setTimeout(..., 0)
block (delayed, but without waiting).

This method can be called on any NavContainer instance or statically on the sap.m.NavContainer type. However, the transition will always be registered for the type (and ALL instances), not for the single instance on which this method was invoked.

Returns the sap.m.NavContainer type if called statically, or "this" (to allow method chaining) if called on a particular NavContainer instance.</documentation>
