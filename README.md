# Augmented Reality shooter with WebXR and SAP UI5

This repository contains the code of a sample project I've used at some conferences to demonstrate how to develop Augmented Reality apps with WebXR and SAP UI5.

A runnable version can be found here: https://grails.de/webxr-ui5/webapp/

On an iPhone or iPad this app requires ARKit which runs on devices with at least an A9 processor or later like the iPhone 6s and iOS 11.
