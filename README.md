# Augmented Reality shooter implemented in WebXR and SAP UI5

This repository contains the code of a sample project I've used at some conferences to demonstrate how to develop Augmented Reality apps with WebXR and SAP UI5.

A runnable version can be found here: https://grails.de/webxr-ui5/webapp/

# Requirements

To be able to run the web app you'll need to install the WebXR Viewer on your iPhone or iPad.

On an iPhone or iPad this app requires ARKit which runs on devices with at least an A9 processor or later like the iPhone 6s and iOS 11.
